The team will locate a number of suitable practices where they can operate out of, this will be communicated widely to staff and patients.

                        <h3>Choice of pathways / specialty’s </h3>
                        <p>Manchester Medics are able to offer a wide range of specialties but in the first instance would like to develop a few targeted areas with the GPs. We have given examples of diabetes and ENT in this prospectus but due to our extensive consultant body we can have in placing clinical service that the commissioners / GPs require.  
                            The administration team for Manchester Medics will liaise closely with the practices, booking patients into clinic slots and ensuring patients are aware of appointments time’s locations and any requirements they may have 
                            MM will work collaboratively with the partners and local service providers and patient groups to ensure a seamless and integrated approach to any service. 
                            We will pay particular attention to helping the GP impacted by any contract we undertake. MM is committed to reducing unnecessary referrals and encouraging the GP community to work in a more structured and integrated way.
                            MM and its partners will provide a full local pathway including outpatient consultations, diagnostic and surgical procedures
