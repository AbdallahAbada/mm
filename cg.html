                    <p>Manchester Medics Limited gained registration in November 2015. The cover is for treatment of disease, disorder, or injury, encompassing assessment, diagnostic, and treatment pathways. The MM senior management team operates within existing CQC approved provider operations, continually demonstrating the management qualities necessary for activities across all intended locations. Our administration handles everything from booking initial consultation appointments to follow-up clinics, managing patient flows, and providing full recovery and aftercare procedures.</p>

                    <p>MM collaborates with established diagnostic partners to provide rapid access to diagnostics on-site in one of the hubs. Our partner, based in Greater Manchester, has a state-of-the-art referral management system to enable efficiencies.

The target for initial responses is two days, with a full response following investigation within two weeks. Responses are provided in writing, and face-to-face meetings are conducted if necessary. Reports on trends and interventions are submitted quarterly to commissioners, adhering to NHS standards and requests for investigations using standard NHS root cause analysis criteria.</p>
