            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>We are a group of consultants who are proud of our NHS heritage. 
                We have come together to form the Manchester medics; this is a chamber approach to delivering high quality pathway care across a number of specialties 
                We are a CQC approved health care provider.
                We are passionate about improving access and care to the people where they live and work.
                We have an organizational structure, which has an overarching partnership of directors with a wide range of associates (clinical consultants) affiliated to the scheme.</p>
            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>MM is committed to working collaboratively with the local health community through GP practices, Clinical Commissioning Groups and Acute Hospital Trusts to be a provider of choice to patients seeking high quality Consultant led care. 
                Our vision is to transform health care in our local communities through evidence-based approaches and endorse the pathways to care through cost saving and streamlined processes. 
                Our ethos is to deliver care to where the patients are and strengthen our ties with the local communities.
                We want to imbed our specialist skills into the local communities by operating out of primary care facilities. This will also allow us to strengthen the relationship with the clinical teams in primary care, something that has been lost over the years but is something that we believe imperative to creating quality patient care.</p>
